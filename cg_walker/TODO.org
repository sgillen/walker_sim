** TODO 


*** TODO should probably integrate controller and walker classes, the function call overhead to compute gains is just too high
*** TODO fix angles for CTYPE = 1

*** TODO just put limits on X you dummy


** Error Codes
*** Badly scaled Fmincon
Warning: Matrix is close to singular or badly scaled. Results may be inaccurate. RCOND =  3.811248e-17.
