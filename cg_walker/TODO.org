** TODO 
*** DONE pass collision events to controller
    add a collision_count to the controller
    done but I still find this janky

*** DONE really should make controller cont variable defualt to zero, and only set it to one if there is unfinished business..
    also still pretty jank

*** DONE Need to create lists of t and X, would be cool to be able to play step by step
    also need to keep track of Xinit and the t we pass to ODE45, should be able to look at take step while we do this..
    
*** TODO not transitioning between states correctly..

*** TODO Pass in model parameters (M,C,G matrices) at object creation time (can this be done...?)


*** TODO should probably seperate each controller into it's own class, just need to make sure that each class has the same functions


*** TODO fix angles for CTYPE = 1, it's weird rn
