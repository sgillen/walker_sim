Three link walker simulation
============================
This is a collection of code developed while studying three link walkers (https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v2i5/IJSRON2013995.pdf) during my first few weeks at UCSB


directory structure
-------------------
* walker - Diretory for intial walker simulation, as described in the link given above, heavily inspired by the acrobot example
 
* walker2 - Same idea as walker but with a slightly modified model, see the comments for more info

* two_link - Does out the forward and reverse kinematics for a two link arm

* katie_examples - Code taken from some of katie's courses, a useful reference

* acrobot files - Katie's code for simulation of the acrobot, walker and walker2 follow the example set here

* cg_torso_files - Katie's code (with some very small modifications) for simulation of a three link walker with a torso

* cg_walker - poorly named, but this is Sean's refactor of cg_torso_files, does the same thing (for now) but it's cleaned up and everything is in a class
