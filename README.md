Three link walker simulation
============================
This is a collection of code developed while studying three link walkers (https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v2i5/IJSRON2013995.pdf) during my first few weeks at UCSB


directory structure
-------------------
* walker - Diretory for intial walker simulation, as described in the link given above, heavily inspired by the acrobot example
 
* walker2 - Same idea as walker but with a slightly modified model, see the comments for more info

* two_link - Does out the forward and reverse kinematics for a two link arm

* katie_examples - Code taken from some of katie's courses, a useful reference

* acrobot files - Katie's code for simulation of the acrobot, walker and walker2 follow the example set here
